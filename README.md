# Tech Demystified

### Deconstructing complex systems into deployable insights.

**Tech Demystified** is a curated repository of technical deep-dives, architectural analyses, and empirical experiments. This project aims to bridge the gap between academic theory and practical application, specifically focusing on AI systems, distributed infrastructure, and developer tooling.

Each article in this repository represents a rigorous "lab report"—testing the limits of modern software, verifying marketing claims with hard metrics, and providing reproducible blueprints for engineers.
